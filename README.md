# Very simple DIY Low Power low cost sensors, Local standalone (no cloud service required) IOT Network.



# Features:

## Very low power consumption.

Proberequest protocol is used for data transfer to conserve power.

## No local linux server or cloud service required.

Whole network can be accesed using any android or ios MQTT front end dashboard client app like MQTT Dash thereby making it very simple to implement. 


## Build it, position towards maximum sun exposure and forget about it. 

No need to charge small 100 mAh LIR2450 coin cell battery manually for life of battery or solar cell if LIR2450 coin cell battery and 53mmx30mm small solar cell linked below in hardware section is used.

## Very low cost DIY sensors.

Average sensor node could be below $5. All the low cost sensors are listed in hardware section below.

## Person Locator/presence detector.

User's presence in the particular room can be located using proberequest protocol thereby allowing further automation based on presence.

## OTA update using github. 

Simply placing .bin file to github and publishing MQTT command from MQTT client app all sensor devices on the network can be updated with latest firmware. Simply publish "command/devicenumber/09/01" from any MQTT client. 

# Concept in detail:

Low battery powered ESP8266 devices using Adhoc Network protocol described (inspiration for me) by Anthony Elder at https://github.com/HarringayMakerSpace/sonoff-adhoc. 


Excellent uMQTTBroker Library by Martin Ger at https://github.com/martin-ger/uMQTTBroker and very well explained at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K9q4IuB_oA&t=9s. 

The device can auto update firmware via Github if specific .bin file is available.Use payload <deviceid>/09/01 under topic "command/".

This code create small standalone network (maximum of 100) of battery powered esp8266 devices connecting to one esp8266 gateway device in star network topology.Each device can be controlled simply by MQTT app like MQTT Dash over local network or over internet if used with DynDNS service like DuckDNS.There is no need for other home automation software locally or on cloud.

My testing shows 18 bytes of data (4 different sensor's values with their respective sensor types + 5 different device status data + battery voltage using 1 byte + device indentifier using 1 byte)  is moved within 55 milliseconds on average thereby saving significant battery power.If two way communication required between gateway and remote sensor then data is communiated both ways within 150 milliseconds (more efficient than ESPNow ?). With two way communication activated even control of actuator is possible but not justifiable for battery powered devices.

Presence detection & user locater within home is implemented in ProbeReceiver sketch.

### Installation:

To use the code 2 ESP8266 devices are required.One device (always on and mains powered) use ProbeReceiver.ino sketch and another device (sleeping most of the time and battery powered) use ProbeSender.ino code.There can be as many as 100 battery powered devices which can send data to one ProbeReceiver device. The wifi channel number of your home access point (fixed if inernet access required) , needs to be same on all ProbeReceiver and ProbeSender devices in order to have least amount of time consumed to exchange the sensor data.In ProbeReceiver.ino sketch ssid and password of your home access point required for access to whole sensor network via MQTT Dash app to read sensor data and to issue commands to remote devices.If presence detection (or user's location finder within the home) is required then user's mobile phone's MAC id is also required.

### Commands to control any remote devices on network by publishing MQTT messages via any MQTT client app (if #define DUPLEX is true in ProbeSender.ino code)

### Command structure:  

commands are issued via MQTT payload with topic name "command/". At least first three commands are necessary.
      
#### Command1 = Device ID Number (required for all commands) -               
```c
- Device ID must be 2 digits end with 2,6,A or E to avoid conflict with other devices.
- See https://serverfault.com/questions/40712/what-range-of-mac-addresses-can-i-safely-use-for-my-virtual-machines.
- use any of following for devie ID ending with 6.
- 06,16,26,36,46,56,66,76,86,96,106,116,126,136,146,156,166,176,186,196,206,216,226,236,246.
- Device ID and last part of fixed IP are same.
```                                            
#### Command2 = Command type  (required for all commands)   -         
```c
- value 01 to 09 is reserved for following commands(must have 0 as first digit):

 - 01 = digitalWright or analogWrite.
           - Example command payload 36/01/01 to 05 or 12 to 16/00 0r 01/ for digitalWrite.
           - Example command payload 36/01/01 to 05 or 12 to 160/2 to 256/ for analogWrite.
 - 02 = digitalRead.
           - Example command payload 36/02/01 to 05 or 12 to 16/
 - 03 = analogRead,
 - 04 = Reserved,
 - 05 = Neopixel etc.
           - Example command payload 36/05/01 to 05 or 12 to 16/00 to 256/00 to 256/00 to 256/
 - 06 =      change sensor types.First byte must be target device id and
           - second byte must be 06 (sensor type voltage). Rest of 4 bytes (each ending with 6) can be changed according to hardware.
           - Example command payload 36/06/16/26/36/46/.

  - 07 =     change wifiChannel.
  - 08 =     change sleepTime.
           - Example command payload 36/08/00 to 255/ (Sleep Time in minutes).
  - 09 =     Activate alternative code for OTA,Wifimanager ETC.
           - Example command payload 36/09/00 or 255/  (01 to activate Auto firmware update).
```
#### Command3 = Command  pinNumber  -    (required for all commands)        
```c
- pinNumber in case of command type 01 to 04 above. 
- Neopixel LED number in case of command type 05.
- Value in case of command type 06,07,08 & 09 commandtype.
- sensorType4 value in case of command 06.
```                                            
#### Command4 = Command value1      -            
```c
- 00 or 255 in case of command type 01 (digitalWrite & analogWrite)  
- or RED neopixel value in case of command type 05 
- or sensorType4 value in case of command 06.
```
#### Command5 = Command value2      -            
```c
- 00 to 255 for GREEN neopixel in case of command type 05 
- or sensorType5 value in case of command 06.
```        
#### Command6 = Command value3      -            
```c
- 00 to 255 for BLUE neopixel in case of command type 05 
- or sensorType6 value in case of command 06.
```

Most suitable use cases around typical home - Weather Station, Door/Window sensor, Water/Oil tank level sensor, Presence Detection sensor, Soil moisture sensor for garden etc.

# uMQTTBroker
MQTT Broker library for ESP8266 Arduino

You can start an MQTT broker in any ESP Arduino project. Just clone (or download the zip-file and extract it) into the libraries directory of your Arduino ESP8266 installation.

**Important: Use the setting "lwip Variant: 1.4 High Bandwidth" in the "Tools" menu**

lwip 2.0 has some strange behaviour that causes the socket to block after 5 connections.

Thanks to Tuan PM for sharing his MQTT client library https://github.com/tuanpmt/esp_mqtt as a basis with us. The modified code still contains the complete client functionality from the original esp_mqtt lib, but it has been extended by the basic broker service.

The broker does support:
- MQTT protocoll versions v3.1 and v3.1.1 simultaniously
- a smaller number of clients (at least 8 have been tested, memory is the issue)
- retained messages
- LWT
- QoS level 0
- username/password authentication
 
The broker does not yet support:
- QoS levels other than 0
- many TCP(=MQTT) clients
- non-clear sessions
- TLS

If you are searching for a complete ready-to-run MQTT broker for the ESP8266 with additional features (persistent configuration, scripting support and much more) have a look at https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_mqtt .

## API MQTT Broker (C++-style)
The MQTT broker has a new C++ style API with a broker class:
```c
class uMQTTBroker
{
public:
    uMQTTBroker(uint16_t portno=1883, uint16_t max_subscriptions=30, uint16_t max_retained_topics=30);

    void init();

    virtual bool onConnect(IPAddress addr, uint16_t client_count);
    virtual bool onAuth(String username, String password);
    virtual void onData(String topic, const char *data, uint32_t length);

    virtual bool publish(String topic, uint8_t* data, uint16_t data_length, uint8_t qos=0, uint8_t retain=0);
    virtual bool publish(String topic, String data, uint8_t qos=0, uint8_t retain=0);
    virtual bool subscribe(String topic, uint8_t qos=0);
    virtual bool unsubscribe(String topic);

    void cleanupClientConnections();
};
```
Use the broker as shown in oo-examples found in https://github.com/martin-ger/uMQTTBroker/tree/master/examples .

## API MQTT Broker (C-style)
The MQTT broker is started by simply including:

```c
#include "uMQTTBroker.h"
```
and then calling
```c
bool MQTT_server_start(uint16_t portno, uint16_t max_subscriptions, uint16_t max_retained_topics);
```
in the "setup()" function. Now it is ready for MQTT connections on all activated interfaces (STA and/or AP). The MQTT server will run in the background and you can connect with any MQTT client. Your Arduino project might do other application logic in its loop.

Your code can locally interact with the broker using these functions:

```c
bool MQTT_local_publish(uint8_t* topic, uint8_t* data, uint16_t data_length, uint8_t qos, uint8_t retain);
bool MQTT_local_subscribe(uint8_t* topic, uint8_t qos);
bool MQTT_local_unsubscribe(uint8_t* topic);


void MQTT_server_onData(MqttDataCallback dataCb);
```

With these functions you can publish and subscribe topics as a local client like you would with any remote MQTT broker. The provided dataCb is called on each reception of a matching topic, no matter whether it was published from a remote client or the "MQTT_local_publish()" function.

Username/password authentication is provided with the following interface:

```c
typedef bool (*MqttAuthCallback)(const char* username, const char *password, struct espconn *pesp_conn);

void MQTT_server_onAuth(MqttAuthCallback authCb);

typedef bool (*MqttConnectCallback)(struct espconn *pesp_conn, uint16_t client_count);

void MQTT_server_onConnect(MqttConnectCallback connectCb);
```

If an *MqttAuthCallback* function is registered with MQTT_server_onAuth(), it is called on each connect request. Based on username, password, and optionally the connection info (e.g. the IP address) the function has to return *true* for authenticated or *false* for rejected. If a request provides no username and/or password these parameter strings are empty. If no *MqttAuthCallback* function is set, each request will be admitted.

The *MqttConnectCallback* function does a similar check for the connection, but it is called right after the connect request before the MQTT connect request is processed. This is done in order to reject requests from unautorized clients in an early stage. The number of currently connected clients (incl. the current one) is given in the *client_count* paramater. With this info you can reject too many concurrent connections.

If you want to force a cleanup when the broker as a WiFi client (WIFI_STA mode) has lost connectivity to the AP, call:
```c
void MQTT_server_cleanupClientCons();
```
This will remove all broken connections, publishing LWT if defined.

Sample: in the Arduino setup() initialize the WiFi connection (client or SoftAP, whatever you need) and somewhere at the end add these line:
```c
MQTT_server_start(1883, 30, 30);
```

You can find a sample sketch here https://github.com/martin-ger/uMQTTBroker/tree/master/examples .

## API MQTT Client

To use the MQTT client functionality include:

```c
#include "MQTT.h"
```

This code is taken from Ingo Randolf from esp-mqtt-arduino (https://github.com/i-n-g-o/esp-mqtt-arduino). It is a wrapper to tuanpmt's esp_mqtt client library. Look here https://github.com/i-n-g-o/esp-mqtt-arduino/tree/master/examples for code samples.
